# Automatic Exam Answers Generator

This project is a simple Python program for getting answers to questions for exams. I created this to get answers to the important questions list form teachers as the exam style is based on memorization. This program will take a file containing a list of questions, with any aditional information and get answers throught the Gemini API and then output them to a file (.txt).

## Files

* `API testing.ipynb` - Test if your API is working as it should and check for any error so that environment is also set up correctly.
* `main.py` - Program that gives the answers to questions in text files and write to another text file.
